<p>
Take to the skies above Yorkshire in a vintage Tiger Moth.
Take control of the aircraft and fly as the early aviators did in a trial lesson and experience the excitement of 1930s style flying.
On the day, arrive at the airfield and receive a preflight briefing from our experienced pilot, dress in our replica flying suits/jackets, and take off.
